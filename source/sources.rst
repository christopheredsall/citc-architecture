Branches and Versioning
-----------------------

We are using `Semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ where we bump the
major version for breaking changes (e.g. between a deployed managment node and
newly booted compute nodes). There is a branch in the terrafrom and ansible
repos for each major version.
